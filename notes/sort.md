## quick sort
### complexity
|       |   time    |  space   |
| :---: | :-------: | :------: |
| mean  | $n\log n$ | $\log n$ |
| worst |   $n^2$   |   $n$    |

### for worst situation
- select key randomly
- select the median as key from the most left num, the most right num and the middle one of the array.

## merge sort
same as quick sort, better than quick sort, it's required to be splitted as two with same size.
