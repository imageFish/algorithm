## max sum of continue subarray
$$
dp[i] = \text{the max sum of subarray ended with arr[i]}
$$
Sometimes, the $dp[i]$ does not mean that the matrix of current subarray, relative matrix that can be used to solve the maxtrix instead.
## i-th ugly number
$$
init \quad a=b=c=0, dp[0] = 1\\
dp[i] = min(dp[a]*2, dp[b]*3, dp[c]*5)\\
a += 1 \quad or \quad b+=1 \quad or \quad c+=1\\
$$
ugly numbert is generated by less ugly number a multiples 2, 3, 5. So init the a, b, c all to 0, and seperately multiples 2, 3, 5, then += 1, to get the current ugly number.
